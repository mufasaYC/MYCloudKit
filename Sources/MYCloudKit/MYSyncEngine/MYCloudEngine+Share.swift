    /// Creates a `CKShare` for the given record, enabling collaboration via CloudKit sharing.
    ///
    /// This function handles both zone-based and record-based sharing transparently:
    ///
    /// - If the record being shared is the root of its group in the `MYRecordConvertible` (i.e. its `myRecordID` is equal to `myRootGroupID`),
    ///   a **zone-level share** is created. This allows sharing the entire group (zone) of related records,
    ///   which is ideal when your model represents a group or project (e.g., a shared folder or task list).
    ///
    /// - Otherwise, a **record-level share** is created using `CKShare(rootRecord:)`, which shares only the specific record
    ///   and its related hierarchy. CloudKit will include all records that are reachable via `.parent` references.
    ///   You define the `myParentID` on the `MYRecordConvertible` and `MYCloudKit` sets this hierarchy up for you!
    ///   So it is important that all related child records in your app properly set the `.parent` field to establish the hierarchy.
    ///   CloudKit uses this structure to determine what records to include in the shared scope.
    ///
    /// The function also checks if an existing share already exists for the record and reuses it if possible.
    /// Both the main record and its share are saved in a single transaction to ensure consistency.
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - title: A displayable title for the share (visible in share sheet).
    ///   - record: The model to be shared, conforming to `MYRecordConvertible`.
    ///
    /// - Returns: A tuple containing the saved `CKShare` and the associated `CKContainer`.
    /// - Throws: An error if the share could not be created or saved.
